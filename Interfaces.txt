definition:- specification to a set of classes

definition 2:- any service requirement specification is called as an interface(SRS).

definition 3:- contract between client and service provider is called as an interface

definition 4:- inside interface every method is always abstract whether we are declaring or not . hence interface is consider as 100% pure abstract classes.

summery definition 
===================
specification to a set of classes or any service requirement specification or contract between client and service provider or 100% pure abstract classes is considered as an interface.

declaration and implementation of an interface 
==============================================

declaration interface-name {
abstract methods;
variables;

}

//every method is always public and abstract by default.
// every variable is public static and final by default.

interface implementation
=========================
public class class-name implements interface-name{
//provide implementation all abstract methods.
// optional-- non-abstract methods.
}

extends vs implements
=====================
1) a class can extends only one class at a time.
2) a class can implement any number of interfaces at a time.

example
=======
public interface One{
}
public interface two{
}

class Hello implements One,Two{
}

3) a class can extends a class and can implement Any number of interfaces at a time.
example:
========
public class A{
}
interface B{
}
interface C{
}

public class D extends A implements B,C{
}
4) an interface can extend any number of interfaces at a time

interface X{
}
interface Y{
}
interface Z{
}
interface A extends X,Y,Z{
}
